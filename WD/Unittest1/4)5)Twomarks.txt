4) *Client-Server Communication (2 Marks)*

Client-server communication is a model where clients (requesters) 
interact with servers (providers) to access resources or services. 
Clients send requests, and servers respond with data or services. 
This interaction relies on protocols like HTTP, SMTP, or FTP. 
The model is stateless, requiring security measures like authentication and encryption. 
It enables web browsing, email, and more, and supports horizontal scalability for increased demand.


5) *World Wide Web (2 Marks)*

The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the web, 
is an interconnected network of information accessible via the internet. 
It consists of web pages, multimedia content, and hyperlinks that allow users 
to navigate between different resources. The web operates using the HTTP protocol, 
and web addresses are specified as URLs. Tim Berners-Lee is credited with its invention,
and it has revolutionized information sharing and communication globally.
